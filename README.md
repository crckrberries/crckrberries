# hello
i write code so outrageously awful that i regularly have to fend off swarms of angry programmers coming to break my legs. i write code so abhorrent it renders the soil dry and the crop rotten. the tears caused by my programmatic malaise could fill my chalice for millenia. i no longer ask if god bleeds, for the answer lies within the color of my hands.
